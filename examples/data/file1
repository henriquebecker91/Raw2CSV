Text between fields does not matter.
No matter how many lines.
only_in_1_and_2 = 1
The only thing that matter, is that a field name is written right, that
there is one space on each side of '=', and that the value of the field
is in the same line and does not have linebreaks.
in_all = A
float_data = 1.0
